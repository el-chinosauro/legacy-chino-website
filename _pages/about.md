## Welcome to my website!

I am an **applied economist** focussing on spatial questions in environmental and development economics. In my work, I apply causal inference designs and machine learning tools to remotely sensed information and large georeferenced datasets. 

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Officer** at the [Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/) and a **Visiting Research Fellow** at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). I completed my **PhD in Environmental Economics** at the LSE in April 2023.

My current research has two main directions. On the one hand, I work on the implications of market-based instruments for climate mitigation in terms of **GHG emissions reductions**, **air quality co-benefits** and **environmental justice**, with an emphasis on the spatial and distributional impacts of carbon taxation. In parallel, I study the impact of economic shocks and policies on the **dynamics of deforestation** in tropical countries, focussing on issues of **additionality and carbon leakage**. In the same context, I have recently started working on the **economics of biodiversity**, and on the relationship between **tropical ecosystem conservation and restoration** and **poverty alleviation**. My work has so far been published on *PNAS*, *Environmental and Resource Economics*, and *Biological Conservation*.
